## Clone the Repository
To get a local copy of this project, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash

```

Replace `https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository-name.git` with the actual URL of your Git repository.

## Navigate to Project Directories

After cloning the repository, navigate into the project directory:

```

Then, enter the `client` directory:

```bash
cd client
```

## Install Client Dependencies
Once you're in the `client` directory, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Start the Client Application
After the installation is complete, start the client application:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Navigate to the Server Directory
In a new terminal window (keeping the client running), navigate back to the project directory and enter the `server` directory:

```bash
cd ../server
```
